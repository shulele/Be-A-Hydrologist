**About Me**: Dr. Shu is an associate professor at Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIEER, CAS). My research interest is in computational hydrologic model, hydrologic data mining, and integrated Coupled Nature-Human System modeling. 

### Research Interests
- Develop and use distributed models to understand the hydrological response from watershed to continental scale, under stress of climate and landuse change.
- Advance data mining and statistical downscaling modeling in hydrology. Data fusion and data mining on traditional hydrological observations and soft data.
- Spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoff, evaporation, subsurface fluxes and in their sensitivity to their controls (e.g. snow fall regime, aridity, reaction coefficients).
- High-performance/parallel computing in hydrologic models.
- Coupled Nature-Human watershed modeling.
